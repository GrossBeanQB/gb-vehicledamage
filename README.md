Hi.

This is a somewhat realistic vehicle damage which I made for QB-core.

I made it as "robust" as possible.

Anything that feels "off" is absolutely free to fix/expand or make it more perfect.

This script includes wheel detachments , more visually seen damage on the vehicles, doors falling off, opening , during hard crashes and etc.

Feel free to do whatever you want with this script.

Config.Lua should be self explainatory.

Hope you like this script and learn more about LUA and qbcore itself, and expand your knowledge.

Have fun.
